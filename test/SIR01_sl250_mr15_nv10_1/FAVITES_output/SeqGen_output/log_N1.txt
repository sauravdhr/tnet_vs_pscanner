Random number generator seed: -8268432473170657146

Simulations of 180 taxa, 264 nucleotides
  for 1 tree(s) with 1 dataset(s) per tree

Alignment read: numSequences = 1, numAlignmentSites = 264
Using sequence 1 as the ancestral sequence

Branch lengths assumed to be number of substitutions per site

Continuous gamma rate heterogeneity:
    shape = 0.100000
Model = GTR: General time reversible (nucleotides)
  Rate of transitions and transversions equal:
  rate matrix = gamma1: 6.4619 alpha1:16.3997  beta1: 3.1970
                                beta2: 0.7505 alpha2:14.6298
                                              gamma2:  1.0000
  with nucleotide frequencies specified as:
  A=0.178159 C=0.263322 G=0.233821 T=0.324698
