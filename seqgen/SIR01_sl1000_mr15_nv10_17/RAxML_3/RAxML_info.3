IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences 160_N220 and 160_N221 are exactly identical


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences 760_N170 and 760_N171 are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 2 sequences that are exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates removed is printed to file seqgen/SIR01_sl1000_mr15_nv10_17/seqgen.seqs.3.reduced

RAxML rapid bootstrapping and subsequent ML search

Using 1 distinct models/data partitions with joint branch length optimization



Executing 25 rapid bootstrap inferences and thereafter a thorough ML search 

All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
GAMMA model of rate heterogeneity, ML estimate of alpha-parameter

GAMMA Model parameters will be estimated up to an accuracy of 0.1000000000 Log Likelihood units
